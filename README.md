# MTB-YouTube

## Background

I'm fascinated with YouTube and how it works. Not only the content of the videos themselves, but the "inside baseball" story of how and why channels become popular. Quite neatly juxtaposing YouTube with my love of cycling is the subject of mountain bike (MTB) videos on YouTube. 

An anecdote to get started: The most popular MTB YouTube channel is Fabio Wibmer, with 2.7M+ subscribers. Unsuprisingly, Fabio is a pro, is sponsored by Red Bull, and makes videos with huge production costs that involve things like riding his bike down a ski resort:

The *second* most popular MTB channel is "Seth's Bike Hacks," with 1.5M+ subscribers. In contrast to Fabio, Seth did not start his channel as a pro, but simply as some dude from Ft. Lauderdale. Seth has been on top of MTB YouTube for awhile now and regularly gets over 1M views per video. Somehow, he grew with channel without being in a hotbed of mountain biking like Colorado or Utah, not Florida. Is his success all intrinsic to the quality of his videos or does he know something about how to position his videos to gain maximum views?
